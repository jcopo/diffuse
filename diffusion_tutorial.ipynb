    "# Foreword: Gaussian Mixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Gaussian Mixture Models for Diffusion-Based Inverse Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This module implements Bayesian inference with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in the context of diffusion processes and linear inverse problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\n",
    "\n",
    "A GMM represents a probability distribution as a weighted sum of \\( K \\) Gaussian components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ p(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^K w_i \\mathcal{N}(x; \\mu_i, \\Sigma_i) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( w_i \\geq 0 \\), \\( \\sum_i w_i = 1 \\) (mixture weights)\n",
    "- \\( \\mu_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\) (component means)\n",
    "- \\( \\Sigma_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d} \\) (component covariance matrices)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Diffusion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion process follows the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ dx(t) = -0.5 \\beta(t) x(t) \\, dt + \\sqrt{\\beta(t)} \\, dW(t) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ x(t) = \\sqrt{\\alpha(t)} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha(t)} \\varepsilon, \\quad \\text{where } \\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( \\alpha(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\beta(s) \\, ds\\right) \\) is the signal preservation ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Closed-Form Solution for GMM + Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "When the prior is a GMM, the diffused distribution remains a GMM:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ p_t(x_t) = \\sum_i w_i \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\mu_i(t), \\Sigma_i(t)) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\mu_i(t) = \\sqrt{\\alpha(t)} \\mu_i(0) \\)\n",
    "- \\( \\Sigma_i(t) = \\alpha(t) \\Sigma_i(0) + (1 - \\alpha(t)) I \\)\n",
    "- \\( w_i(t) = w_i(0) \\) (weights unchanged)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Bayesian Posterior with Linear Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Given measurement: \\( y = Ax + \\varepsilon \\), where \\( \\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_y^2 I) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior is also a GMM:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ p(x|y) = \\sum_i \\bar{w}_i \\mathcal{N}(x; \\bar{\\mu}_i, \\bar{\\Sigma}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{\\Sigma} = \\left(I + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_y^2} A^T A\\right)^{-1} \\)\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{\\mu}_i = \\bar{\\Sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma_y^2} A^T y + \\mu_i \\right) \\)\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{w}_i \\propto w_i \\times p(y|\\mu_i) \\)\n",
    "- \\( p(y|\\mu_i) = \\mathcal{N}(y; A\\mu_i, \\sigma_y^2 I + A A^T) \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "This conjugacy property makes GMMs particularly useful for diffusion-based inverse problems, as the posterior can be computed analytically at each step."
